# EarthModel
A simple interactive earth sim

Morning all.


So heres a piece of code I put together to simulate the earths rotation.

Originally it was to show that the "circle" of the earth can still be a sphere.

Ill eventually add the ability to enable "snow globe" mode which makes christian apologists out to be even more stupid.


VERSION

0.060: Added "God". Fixed the cursor key behaviour
0.050: Bug Fixes (mainly input and UI, one based on axial tilt change - modified rotation system to rotate earth's "camera" instead of the earth itself see 0.045)
0.045: changed axial tilt to be easier to deal with moving camera
0.040: Implemented 1st version of Axial tilt
0.030: Implemented multiple lights to enable and disable shading
0.025: Interface created with information box
0.020: Added clouds, Kármán boundary and backing stars
